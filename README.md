This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Setting up the Backend

To run the backend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `api` folder:
   ```bash
   cd api
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Navigate to the `src` folder:
   ```bash
   cd src
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

Make sure you have configured your environment variables and database before running the backend.
